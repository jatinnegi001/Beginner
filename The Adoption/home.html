              <p>Dogs are believed to be first domesticated by the ancient Egyptians over 8,000 years
              ago around 2600 BC. They were later venerated as a sacred animal and were even 
              mummified by the Egyptians when they died.
              It was only in the 19th century that the first pedigree(with a family lineage) breeds 
              were developed. In fact, more than 300 breeds and varieties are recognised now, the 
              main distinguishing characteristics being head shape and the length of hair.
